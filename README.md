Initially the only coins that will be available will be those distrubuted to black charities and black-owned businesses. Coins will be dispursed in installments, again as to protect flooding the supply at any given time. If adopted as a fund-raising and transactional medium, MLK Coins are expected to gain value as their demand increases. 

Supply
At just 2 Million total coins, MLK Coin will be among one of the rarest alternative cryptocoins available. Many times rarer than BitCoin (21M), LiteCoin (84M), DogeCoin (>100M), NameCoin (21M), AuroraCoin (30M), or BlackCoin (No Limit). Scarcity is important as many coins have too much supply and not enough demand which tends to diminish the values of the coins. 

Demand
MLK Coin will be only 10% pre-mined allowing for miners to effectively mine coins and enter them into the market place fairly over time without flooding the market. In time, certain exchanges are expected to open up trading of MLK Coin so that the general public can buy and sell coins.
